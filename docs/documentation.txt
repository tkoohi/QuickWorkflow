For workflow analysis and even more (workflow simplification, classification, etc) we need the logic of a workflow. In this case we offer an insight in which 3 logic relations may defined:
A Relation in most workflow analysis is in three types: 
The first is 'And Relation' Type. The 'and Relation' type, also names 'and branches', 'judgment branches', 'broadcast brancehs', 'broad cast relation' and etc.
The second relation is 'Xor relation'. The xor relation type is an 'or' in workflow logic that it is true if just one of the relations is true. 
The third relation is the 'Or relation'. Or means that we have options for choose.
